        answer: '<p>There are now scores of solutions appearing to meet what till now has been a huge hidden market for video capture from the field. ' +
        'Although almost all users capturing video from the field already have a camera and laptop, these solutions often require the user to add another heavy box' + 'or' +
        'backpack, or they are very expensive services, or lock the user to a set of carrier services or specific IP network(s),' +

        answer:
        '<p>The Vazzt encoder that comes with the capture software can now encode at anything up to and including Video at 1080p (1920x1080 pixels, 30 frames per second, with 65K color).  The camera/laptop can be very simple and inexpensive for standard IPTV, but expensive for a full HD IPTV configuration. ' +
        'Vazzt Capture Software will automatically read the default video resolutions available from the camera you attach to the laptop/computer with the Vazzt Capture Server software.

                    '<li>(320x240) For the Capture Server use a netbook with built in webcam, subscribe to 2 carrier wireless data services at $60 per month each ($120/month).  There is no other recurring cost for the capture server operation.  You can also bond together WiFi and other IP network services, when available, with the 2 carrier services to get higher resolution, but webcams do not yet have higher resolution capability.</li>' +
                    '<li>(720x480) Use a laptop for Capture Server with a prosumer camera and 3 carrier wireless data services for only about $180/month recurring cost. </li>' +
                    '<li>(1440x1080) Use a good laptop for Capture Server with a pro camera and 6-7 carrier 3G wireless data services for excellent bandwidth for about $360/month recurring cost.</li>' +

        '<p>Several key transmission technologies enable Vazzt to: </p>' +
        '<ul>' +
            '<li><strong>Detect</strong> available IP networks & bandwidth</li>' +
                '<li>Upon launch, Vazzt will explore the immediate vicinity and detect any IP network for which the user&#39s computer has been previously configured.</li>' +  
            '<li><strong>Accelerate</strong> delivery on identified networks</li>' +
                '<li>Uses KenCast&#39s patent pending IP Acceleration methods (bandwidth is pushed up on each network found)</li>' +

                '<li>Uses KenCast patent and patent pending technology in network diversity and split/join channeling to achieve bonding.</li>' +
                   '<li>Quickly tests the total composite bandwidth of the super pipe sets the default encoding rate based on the test (the user can override the default bandwidth and single-click for a preset profile to ensure a desired, consistent quality, if preferred; or the user can manually configure a custom profile; and IT support at the central hub can remotely access the userÕs laptop and manually configure an appropriate profile)</li>' +
            '<li><strong>Load Balance</strong> by shifting outgoing packets from slowing networks to rising networks.</li>' +
                '<li>Vazzt monitors the performance of each of the bonded networks and allocates the packets among the networks for optimal distribution.</li>' +

            '<li><strong>Secure</strong> the live streams with encryption, and secure files also.</li>' +
                '<li>This is done using 256-bit AES encryption on the bonded pipe. So live streams and files sent over the pipe are very secure. Keys for deciphering are distributed using SSL type security connection. ' +
